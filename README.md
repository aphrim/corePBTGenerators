# corePBTGenerators
Scripts to generate PBTs. Currently in Python And Javascript versions

How To Use
Import and then use like the examples in the bottom of the python/javascript script shows. Will add more examples eventually.

I would reccomend using javascript one as python one is still a bit WIP, python one has same functionality but a bit harder to use when calling AddMesh().
